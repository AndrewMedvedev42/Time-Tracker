# Time Tracker

Time Traker allows you to create timers and store them.

## Tools used :
### React
In this project, I used React because I can create a much better layout, easy control state, and use self-made or third-party components.

The abitly to add new timer I used useState. To store timers I used localStorage to save name of the timer and the it's time. To display existing timers I used useEffect

For icons, I used the "react-icons" library.

### Styles

As a method for styling, I used SASS to make the style process more stabilized.

## Note: If instead of time you see "NaN" output, thats means there are some items in your localStorage that is not do not fit for requirements of timer's compiler.
